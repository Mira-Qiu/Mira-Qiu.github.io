The drawn line slowly shows up duration(2000 ms), it means more data shows after this chart.

### Annotations:

The annotations template is easy to understand format, which shows the year and the positions number, or the year and the salary. I choose it because it is easy and clearly shows just up above the point. The annotations are great support the messaging since it shows the data and the information in details every year. The annotations changed within a single scene in slowly come out from the left corner, and disappear after the mouse move out. Besides, after the viewer clicks the point, the circle point change to orange color easy to check what data had been viewed. It is easy for the viewer to click and want to check the details.

Triggers The Button tab and circled out point on the chart were using a light color and shows that it can be clicked. The link lines to draw a line is the regular what we had familiar of the link format, the blue words with an underline.
